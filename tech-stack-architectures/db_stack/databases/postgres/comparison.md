## Comparison of PostgreSQL Replication Methods

This section compares different replication methods based on various criteria such as use cases, resource usage, correctness, and performance.

### Scenario 1: Based on Use Case

| Replication Method        | Ideal Use Case                                                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Streaming Replication**  | High availability, real-time data synchronization                | Ensures continuous replication with minimal data loss and fast recovery.    |
| **Replication Slot**       | Reliable WAL retention, avoiding WAL file loss                   | Guarantees that the standby always gets the WAL files it needs, even if disconnected. |
| **Logical Replication Slot** | Partial data replication, replicating specific tables/rows      | Allows more granular replication of individual tables, useful for selective replication. |
| **Synchronous Replication** | Zero data loss for critical transactions                         | Ensures that transactions are confirmed on both primary and standby servers before committing. |
| **Cascading Replication**  | Large distributed systems, multiple layers of standby servers     | Enables hierarchical replication, reducing load on the primary.             |
| **WAL Shipping (Archiving)** | Low bandwidth, delayed replication                              | Suitable for scenarios where continuous streaming isn't possible, such as cold standby. |
| **Hot Standby**            | Read-heavy workloads, load balancing                             | Provides a read-only standby for query offloading while replicating data from the primary. |

### Scenario 2: Based on Resource Usage

| Replication Method        | CPU Usage  | Memory Usage | Disk Usage                | Network Usage  |
|---------------------------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Streaming Replication**  | Moderate   | Low          | Moderate (WAL segments)    | Continuous, moderate |
| **Replication Slot**       | Low        | Low          | High (retained WAL files)  | Low (if standby offline) |
| **Logical Replication Slot** | Moderate | Moderate     | High (retains logical changes) | Continuous, low to moderate |
| **Synchronous Replication** | High      | High         | Moderate                   | High (needs confirmation) |
| **Cascading Replication**  | Low (primary), High (intermediary) | Low to Moderate | Moderate | Moderate to High (intermediary standbys) |
| **WAL Shipping (Archiving)** | Low      | Low          | High (WAL archives)        | Low (periodic transfer) |
| **Hot Standby**            | Moderate   | Moderate     | Low                        | Continuous, moderate |

### Scenario 3: Based on Correctness (Data Consistency and Durability)

| Replication Method        | Data Consistency                    | Durability         | Notes                                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Streaming Replication**  | **Eventual Consistency**            | High (minimal data loss) | Standby may lag slightly but will catch up quickly. |
| **Replication Slot**       | **Eventual Consistency**            | High               | Prevents WAL loss during standby disconnects.     |
| **Logical Replication Slot** | **Eventual Consistency**           | High               | Used for partial, selective replication.          |
| **Synchronous Replication** | **Strong Consistency**             | **Very High**      | No transaction is committed unless it’s confirmed by the standby, zero data loss. |
| **Cascading Replication**  | **Eventual Consistency**            | High               | Intermediate standbys may experience slight delays. |
| **WAL Shipping (Archiving)** | **Eventual Consistency**          | High               | Suitable for delayed or cold standby replication. |
| **Hot Standby**            | **Eventual Consistency (read-only)** | High               | Standby can serve queries while staying slightly behind. |

### Scenario 4: Based on Performance

| Replication Method        | Latency         | Write Throughput       | Read Scalability    | Notes                                            |
|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Streaming Replication**  | Low             | High                   | Moderate            | Replication is continuous, with minimal impact on performance. |
| **Replication Slot**       | Low             | High                   | Moderate            | Similar performance to streaming, with WAL retention. |
| **Logical Replication Slot** | Moderate       | Moderate                | High (for selected tables) | Useful for specific data replication needs but adds some overhead. |
| **Synchronous Replication** | **High**        | Low to Moderate         | Low                 | Increased latency due to waiting for standby confirmation. |
| **Cascading Replication**  | Low (primary)   | High (primary), Moderate (intermediary) | High (distributed queries) | Offloads primary by distributing read traffic to cascading standbys. |
| **WAL Shipping (Archiving)** | High           | High                   | Low                 | High latency as WAL files are transferred and applied periodically. |
| **Hot Standby**            | Low             | N/A (read-only)         | **Very High**       | Provides fast read-only access, reducing load on the primary. |

### Summary

Each replication method serves different purposes depending on the requirements of the system. Here’s a quick guide to when you should use each:

- **Use streaming replication** when you need continuous, real-time replication for high availability.
- **Use replication slots** when you want to ensure that a standby or logical replication subscriber can safely catch up even after a disconnection.
- **Use logical replication slots** when you need more granular control over what data gets replicated.
- **Use synchronous replication** for zero data loss scenarios, typically in critical systems where every transaction must be preserved.
- **Use cascading replication** when scaling replication across multiple servers while reducing the primary server's load.
- **Use WAL shipping (archiving)** when replication bandwidth is limited or you need a cold standby setup.
- **Use hot standby** when you want to scale read-heavy workloads across multiple servers while maintaining high availability.

By evaluating the scenarios of use case, resource usage, correctness, and performance, you can select the optimal PostgreSQL replication strategy that aligns with your system’s specific needs.
